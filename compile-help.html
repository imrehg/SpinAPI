				<P><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This document describes how to
				interface with the spinapi control library, which is used to
				control all of our products. The spinapi control library is a
				standard windows .dll which can be accessed from a wide variety
				of programming environments, such as C/C++ programs, etc.</P>
				<P><FONT SIZE=4>Accessing spinapi from a C/C++ program</FONT></P>
				<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This section describes the basic steps
				needed to get your C/C++ program to work with spinapi.&nbsp;
				Virtually any C/C++ compiler/programming environment is
				compatible, feel free to use your favorite.&nbsp; If you do not
				currently have a C/C++ compiler, there are several high quality
				compilers available for free download on the internet, see below
				for some recommendations.</P>
				<P>&nbsp;Four files are necessary to be able to control your
				board using this approach.</P>
				<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in"><I>.c/.cpp file</I>: This is the
				program itself. Several example C programs are included for each
				of our different products.<BR><BR><I>spinapi.h:</I> The spinapi
				header file. This contains the function declarations and
				definitions which are needed to access the spinapi functions.
				This should be #included in all files which use the spinapi
				functions. (#include &quot;spinapi.h&quot;)</P>
				<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in"><I>Import library:</I> This
				library must be linked with your program so it will know to look
				inside the spinapi.dll file to find the API functions. There are
				several different file formats for import libraries, so we have
				provided three different ones so that all compilers can be
				supported. Choose whichever is appropriate for the compiler you
				are using.</P>
				<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.42in">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; libspinapi.a:
				GCC based compilers (such as MinGW)</P>

					<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">We highly recommend you check
					the result of the <I>pb_get_version()</I> function at the
					beginning of each program. This way, if you upgrade to a newer
					version of spinapi, you can check to make sure your program is
					not accidentally still using the older version of the library. 
					</P>
					<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Checking the return value of
					all spinapi functions is highly recommended. This way you will
					be able to detect common errors (such as entering too short a
					time for an instruction length, etc.)</P>
					<LI><P>If you encounter difficulties controlling your board with
					spinapi, you can enable debugging features by calling
					<I>pb_set_debug(1)</I> on the first line of your program. This
					will create file called log.txt when you run your program, which
					can then be emailed to us along with a description of the
					problem to help us solve your problem as quickly as possible.</P>
